      <description>This is a non-mathematical note on what I understand about compactness and what it means for a set or a space to be compact. The open cover definition is one that can be found in any textbook, but what does it mean for a set to be compact? Why are such sets called compact? And how do compact sets differ from those which are not?
I think the terminology here is very carefully chosen.</description>

      <title>Instrumentals v/s Vocal Music</title>

      <description>I often talk to friends about music and musical preferences. This post is inspired by one such theme which often finds its way in most of these conversations: instrumental music v/s vocal music. Or more precisely, why listen to instrumental, or plain music, when you can have vocals accompanying the music.
This post is not from a musical perspective, but rather to emphasize on the entirely separate form of beauty inherent in instrumental music.</description>

      <title>Point Estimate</title>

      <description>Point estimation problem A generic point estimation problem goes like this: Consider a random variable \(x\sim f(x;\theta)\) with the parameter \(\theta\in\Omega\). Here \(f(x;\theta)\) corresponds to a family of distributions rather than a single probability distribution. We are interested in finding a point estimate to the parameter \(\theta\). In order to do that, we draw a random sample with \(n\) realizations of the random variable \(x\) as \(\tilde{X}=\{x_1=X_1,x_2=X_2,\cdots, x_n=X_n\}\). In shorthand, this realization from the \(n\) experiments of the given family of distribution is also written as simply \(\{X_1,X_2,\cdots,X_n\}\).</description>
