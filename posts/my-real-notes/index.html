			<p>When I took the course on Real Analysis, it made me very nervous. I was having fever dreams from the past when I took undergraduate real analysis and the epsilon-delta definitions just did not make a lot of sense. In retrospect, taking MA504 has been one of the best academic decisions, especially as an engineer.</p>

<p>It has helped me a lot in how to concretely formulate definitions, and what &lsquo;approaching&rsquo;, &lsquo;tending&rsquo;, &lsquo;limiting&rsquo;, and other weasel words mean in a mathematical sense.</p>

<p>I tried to make notes of the course throughout, and am making entirety of them <a href="../../Real_Analysis_Notes.pdf">available here</a>.
How, I feel, these differ from the textbook (Baby Rudin) and the course notes, is in the sense that they are more concise, I skip over the proofs, and (I think) they are more approachable to an undergraduate level audience.
Please feel free to collaborate as this is an <a href="https://github.com/omanshuthapliyal/Real-Analysis-Notes">ongoing repository</a> and I will add/subtract from it whenever I get time.</p>

<p>These notes at places are shameful regurgitations of <a href="https://www.math.purdue.edu/~arshak/S19/MA504/">Prof. Petrosyan&rsquo;s course</a> notes and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Mathematical-Analysis-Rudin/dp/1259064786/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=real+analysis+rudin&amp;qid=1566672781&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-1">Baby Rudin</a>.</p>
