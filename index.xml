      <description>This is going to take some time and effort to read, as it took to write; but Iâ€™ll try to answer to my best knowledge. I will follow a standard approach, but any terms that require some prior knowledge would contain wiki links.
##Background
MAP (maximum a priori estimate), MLE (maximum likelihood estimate) and MoM (method of moments) in this context refer to point estimation problems and are among many other estimation methods in statistics.</description>

      <title>Instrumentals v/s Vocal Music</title>

      <description>I often talk to friends about music and musical preferences. This post is inspired by one such theme which often finds its way in most of these conversations: instrumental music v/s vocal music. Or more precisely, why listen to instrumental, or plain music, when you can have vocals accompanying the music.
This post is not from a musical perspective, but rather to emphasize on the entirely separate form of beauty inherent in instrumental music.</description>
