      <title>The Industry-Academia split in Control Systems</title>

      <description>I often wonder why the &amp;quot;cutting edge&amp;quot; research that we read about in the foremost scientific journals &amp;amp; conferences in Control Systems are never applied in the industry. Because whenever we read/write papers, Section-I always tries to ground itself to industry and/or practical applications. However, it&#39;s pretty well known that a majority of the controllers used in the industry are still tuned PIDs. Even though sub-fields of modern control -- adaptive, and robust control are very mature and pretty old in their own rights, the real world&#39;s inertia against using modern control techniques bears substantial weight.</description>
