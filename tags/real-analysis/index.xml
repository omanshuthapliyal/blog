      <description>When I took the course on Real Analysis, it made me very nervous. I was having fever dreams from the past when I took undergraduate real analysis and the epsilon-delta definitions just did not make a lot of sense. In retrospect, taking MA504 has been one of the best academic decisions, especially as an engineer.
It has helped me a lot in how to concretely formulate definitions, and what &amp;lsquo;approaching&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;tending&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;limiting&amp;rsquo;, and other weasel words mean in a mathematical sense.</description>

      <title>But why is Compactness important?</title>

      <description>In my last post I touched upon the intuition behind topological compactness. We as engineers often hear about the word &#39;compact&#39; as a soft gatekeeping tool from doing serious mathematics. In this post we see why the understanding is very important for doing any mathematics, especially as engineers.
Recall the open cover definition of a compact set as the existence of a finite open subcover for any given open cover of the set.</description>

      <description>This is a non-mathematical note on what I understand about compactness and what it means for a set or a space to be compact. The open cover definition is one that can be found in any textbook, but what does it mean for a set to be compact? Why are such sets called compact? And how do compact sets differ from those which are not?
I think the terminology here is very carefully chosen.</description>
