      <description>This is my attempt to try to motivate and justify why I am studying what I study, and to try to justify the title of my dissertation.
While most emphasis on safety has been provided from a model-driven perspective, data-driven approaches present a novel semi model-driven method by employing model-discovery. As data becomes more inexpensive, and system capabilities highly nonlinear, and often subject to parameter variations during mission, data-driven approaches are utilized more and more in controls engineering.</description>
