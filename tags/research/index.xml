      <title>Why I am studying this: Data Driven Safety</title>

      <description>This is my attempt to try to motivate and justify why I am studying what I study, and to try to justify the title of my dissertation.
While most emphasis on safety has been provided from a model-driven perspective, data-driven approaches present a novel semi model-driven method by employing model-discovery. As data becomes more inexpensive, and system capabilities highly nonlinear, and often subject to parameter variations during mission, data-driven approaches are utilized more and more in controls engineering.</description>

      <description>One of my fellow grad students shared a paper with me that turned out to be a great read. It was Professor Freeman Dyson&#39;s article titled Birds and Frogs, that was the invited Einstein lecture at the American Mathematical Society. Dyson talks about two categories of mathematicians (researchers) -- birds, and frogs. While birds soar high, and get a view of the entire landscape, frogs tread tread deep, looking for details.</description>
