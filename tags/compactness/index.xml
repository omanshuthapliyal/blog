      <description>In my last post I touched upon the intuition behind topological compactness. We as engineers often hear about the word &#39;compact&#39; as a soft gatekeeping tool from doing serious mathematics. In this post we see why the understanding is very important for doing any mathematics, especially as engineers.
Recall the open cover definition of a compact set as the existence of a finite open subcover for any given open cover of the set.</description>

      <description>This is a non-mathematical note on what I understand about compactness and what it means for a set or a space to be compact. The open cover definition is one that can be found in any textbook, but what does it mean for a set to be compact? Why are such sets called compact? And how do compact sets differ from those which are not?
I think the terminology here is very carefully chosen.</description>
