      <description>This is a non-mathematical note on what I understand about compactness and what it means for a set or a space to be compact. The open cover definition is one that can be found in any textbook, but what does it mean for a set to be compact? Why are such sets called compact? And how do compact sets differ from those which are not?
I think the terminology here is very carefully chosen.</description>
